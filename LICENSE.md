**(d) Commercial Use**
You may use the material commercially under the following conditions:

**(e) Republish or Mirror the Site**
You may republish or mirror the site, including code and content, only under the following conditions:

* The mirrored or republished instance must be a verbatim and complete copy of the original, with no modifications to layout, structure, style, content, metadata, filenames, or any associated assets.

* No additions, deletions, reformatting, localization, annotations, ads, scripts, or analytics may be introduced.

* The original URL structure, authorship attribution, and all credits must be preserved without alteration or substitution.

* The mirrored or republished instance must identify itself as a mirror or archive, and must link to the original source in a prominent and permanent manner.

* No attempt may be made to obscure, replace, or simulate the original Unconcurrent site, its identity, branding, or authorship, in any technical, visual, or contextual way.

* The mirrored or republished content may not be embedded within a broader site, frame, template, or service that implies derivation, endorsement, or affiliation.

* No commercial use, monetization, or indirect revenue generation may be associated with the mirror, including through ads, paywalls, affiliate links, newsletter collection, SEO exploitation, or traffic redirection.

Any action that modifies, recontextualizes, frames, indexes selectively, or presents the content with the intent to replace, compete with, or simulate the original source — whether technically, visually, or by implication — is expressly prohibited.
