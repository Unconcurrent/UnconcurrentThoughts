SoloDB now has its own home at [solodb.org](https://solodb.org).

## What's on the Site

The new website provides everything you need to get started:

- **Quick Start** — Install with `dotnet add package SoloDB` and see working code in seconds
- **Documentation** — Complete API reference, from basic CRUD operations to advanced features like transactions, file storage, and custom ID generators
- **Code Examples** — Syntax-highlighted snippets showing indexing, transactions, file storage, and more

## Why a Dedicated Site

As SoloDB grows, having comprehensive documentation in one place makes it easier to learn and reference. The site is lightweight and fast — each page loads in a single request and doesn't even require JavaScript to display.

## Get Started

Head to [solodb.org](https://solodb.org) to explore the library, or jump straight to the [documentation](https://solodb.org/docs.html).

The source remains on [GitHub](https://github.com/Unconcurrent/SoloDB) where you can star the project, report issues, or contribute.
