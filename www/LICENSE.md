**(d) Commercial Use**
You may use the material commercially under the following conditions:

* The commercial application must not serve directly or indirectly to the same audience.

**(e) Republish or Mirror the Site**
You may republish or mirror the site, including code and content, only under the following conditions:

* The mirrored or republished instance must be a verbatim and complete copy of the original, with no modifications to layout, structure, style, content, metadata, filenames, or any associated assets.

* No additions, deletions, reformatting, localization, annotations, ads, scripts, or analytics may be introduced.

* The original URL structure, authorship attribution, and all credits must be preserved without alteration or substitution.

* The mirrored or republished instance must identify itself as a mirror or archive, and must link to the original source in a prominent and permanent manner.

* No attempt may be made to obscure, replace, or simulate the original Unconcurrent site, its identity, branding, or authorship, in any technical, visual, or contextual way.

* The mirrored or republished content may not be embedded within a broader site, frame, template, or service that implies derivation, endorsement, or affiliation.

* No commercial use, monetization, or indirect revenue generation may be associated with the mirror, including through ads, paywalls, affiliate links, newsletter collection, SEO exploitation, or traffic redirection.

Any action that modifies, recontextualizes, frames, indexes selectively, or presents the content with the intent to replace, or compete with the original source - whether technically, visually, or by implication - is expressly prohibited.

### 7. WARRANTY

THE WEBSITE AND ITS CONTENT/SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS," TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. THE OPERATOR OF THIS WEBSITE AND ANY AFFILIATED PARTIES (COLLECTIVELY, "THE OPERATOR") DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY, ACCURACY, AND PERFORMANCE OF THE WEBSITE AND ITS CONTENT/SERVICES IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE WEBSITE OR ITS CONTENT/SERVICES PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR, OR CORRECTION.

### 8. LIABILITY

IN NO EVENT, UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING, SHALL THE OPERATOR OF THIS WEBSITE, ITS COPYRIGHT HOLDERS, OR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN PROVIDING THE WEBSITE OR ITS CONTENT/SERVICES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. THIS INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE WEBSITE OR ITS CONTENT/SERVICES (SUCH AS LOSS OF DATA, INACCURATE DATA, LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES, OR FAILURE OF THE WEBSITE TO OPERATE WITH OTHER APPLICATIONS), EVEN IF THE OPERATOR OR SUCH OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

### 9. Interpretation and Severability

If any part of these disclaimers of warranty or limitations of liability cannot be given full legal effect according to their terms under applicable local law, the reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Website and its Content/Services, unless a specific warranty or assumption of liability is explicitly provided and agreed upon in writing for a fee. If any provision of this license is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
